\chapter{General Description of LIGNUM}

To describe the growth and development of a tree in LIGNUM we use 

More formally, let us denote the status of the tree at
one moment of time $ t $ with $ x(t)$, the functions, parameters
external conditions (e.g., weather) etc. needed to describe the
behaviour  of the tree with $ u(t) $ and
the transit variables with $ \theta $ then we can write $
f(x(t),\theta, u(t)) \rightarrow g(x_{1}(t)) \rightarrow x(t+1) $
where $ f $ is the model (implemented e.g. as a computer program).
