\section{Namespace}\label{sec:namespace}
LIGNUM is designed as a  single tree model for hardwood and coniferous
species.  To  allow modeling the  development of mixed  species forest
stands (in the future) we  have augmented the original definition of L
with  the   concept  of  namespace  denoted   with  \texttt{open}  and
\texttt{close}    statements    (see    Appendix   \ref{sec:L1}    and
\ref{sec:L2}).     A    namespace     is    a    scope    or    module
\citep{stroustrup:97}),  a  mechanism to  express  things that  belong
logically together without adding too much notational burden.
 
Technically, each L  file is compiled to C++, hence  it is possible to
embed C++ statements in the productions. The result of the compilation
is  a C++  class providing  application programming  interface  to the
L-system  defined. This  includes derivation  of the  string  to model
structural   development  and   the   conversion  algorithm   (Section
\ref{sec:pine}).  Implementing namespace each L system definition will
be  enclosed into its  own unique  namespace. Thus  it is  possible to
design, implement and assign a specific L-system to an individual tree
model realized in LIGNUM enabling the modeling of several tree species
and multiple individual trees  in a single application. This completes
our study.
