\section{Namespace}\label{sec:namespace}  

LIGNUM  is  designed as  a  single  tree  model for  broad-leaved  and
coniferous species.  To allow modeling the development of mixed forest
stands (in the future), we have augmented the original definition of L
with  the   concept  of  namespace  denoted   with  \texttt{open}  and
\texttt{close}    statements    (see    Appendix   \ref{sec:L1}    and
\ref{sec:L2}).     A    namespace     is    a    scope    or    module
\citep{stroustrup:97},  a  mechanism to  express  things that  belong
logically together without adding too much notational burden.
 
Technically, as  each L file is  translated to C++, it  is possible to
embed C++ statements in the productions. The result of the translation
is a C++  class providing an application programming  interface to the
defined L  system.  This  includes derivation of  the string  to model
structural   development  and   the   conversion  algorithm   (Section
\ref{sec:pine}).  By implementing  namespace, each L system definition
will be enclosed  in its own unique namespace. Thus  it is possible to
design, implement and assign a specific L system to an individual tree
model realized in  LIGNUM, thus enabling the modeling  of several tree
species and multiple individual trees in a single application.
