  development  takes place  according  to the  L  program of  Appendix
  \ref{sec:L1} and metabolic functioning is as in \citet{perttunen:96,

  depicting the effect of  foliage mortality.  Middle: Foliage remains
  for 5  years.  Length  = 3.5 m,  diameter at  base = 10  cm.  Right:
  Foliage remains for 1 year.  Length = 2.7 m, diameter at base 6 cm.}
