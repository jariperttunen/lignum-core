\section{Basics of L-systems}

Mathematically L-systems  are parallel rewriting  systems operating on
strings of symbols. An L-system  is defined by an alphabet of symbols,
a  set of  rewriting rules  called productions  and an  initial string
called axiom. In a production  written as $a \rightarrow S$ the symbol
$a$ is called  predecessor and the string $S$  successor.  For example
define  the  alphabet of  two  symbols  $A$ and  $B$  the  set of  the
following two rules:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AB}
1: A \rightarrow B \qquad 2: B \rightarrow AB 
\end{equation}
Starting from  the axiom  $A$ the first  five strings produced  by the
L-system are $A$, $B$, $AB$ and $BAB$ and $ABBAB$.

In context-free L-systems  (as Eq.  \ref{eq:AB}) predecessor's context
does  not  influence  production  application.   In  context-sensitive
L-systems written as $S_l < a > S_r \rightarrow S$, the symbol $a$ can
produce string  $S$ if  and only  if $a$ is  preceded by  string $S_l$
(left context) and followed by string $S_r$ (right context).

In plant modeling  context the symbols of the  alphabet in an L-system
represent the units (internodes, leaves, flowers etc.)  of the growing
organism relevant to modeling approach and the string of symbols their
topological ordering.  To be able to generate the branching structures
dominant in plant world the notion of strings with brackets (literally
denoting  begin and  end  of branch  with  '[' and  ']') or  bracketed
L-systems   was   already    present   in   the   original   formalism
\citep{lindenmayer:68}.    In   parametric  L-systems   \citep{pp:90a}
symbols   may  take  numerical   arguments  to   capture  conveniently
continuous  phenomena like  diffusion  of substances  in an  organism.
Symbols in parametric L-systems  are also called modules.  To describe
the  geometry  and  for  the  graphical interpretation  of  the  model
structures \citet{pp:86}  introduced L-system symbols  as instructions
controlling   a   LOGO-style   turtle  \citep{abelson:82}   in   three
dimensions, hence the adopted name Turtle graphics.
