\section{Principles of L systems}

Mathematically L  systems are parallel rewriting  systems operating on
strings of symbols. An L system  is defined by an alphabet of symbols,
a set  of rewriting  rules called productions,  and an  initial string
called an  axiom. In  a production written  as $a \rightarrow  S$, the
symbol $a$ is called the predecessor and the string $S$ the successor.
For example, define  the alphabet of two symbols $A$  and $B$, and the
set of following two rules:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:AB}
1: A \rightarrow B \qquad 2: B \rightarrow AB 
\end{equation}
Starting from the axiom $A$, the  first five strings produced by the L
system are $A$, $B$, $AB$ and $BAB$ and $ABBAB$.

In context-free  L systems (as in Eq.   \ref{eq:AB}) the predecessor's
context   does   not  influence   the   production  application.    In
context-sensitive L systems, written as $S_l < a > S_r \rightarrow S$,
the symbol $a$ can produce a string $S$ if and only if $a$ is preceded
by the  string $S_l$ (left context)  and followed by  the string $S_r$
(right context).

In the  plant modeling  context the  symbols of the  alphabet in  an L
system represent the units  (internodes, leaves, flowers etc.)  of the
growing organism relevant to the  modeling approach, and the string of
symbols  their  topological ordering.   To  be  able  to generate  the
branching  structures  dominant in  the  plant  world,  the notion  of
strings with brackets  (literally denoting the beginning and  end of a
branch with '[' and ']') or bracketed L systems was already present in
the  original  formalism   \citep{lindenmayer:68}.   In  parametric  L
systems  \citep{pp:90a},  symbols  may  take  numerical  arguments  to
capture  conveniently  continuous  phenomena  like  the  diffusion  of
substances in an  organism.  Symbols in parametric L  systems are also
called modules.  

To describe the geometry, and also for the graphical interpretation of
the  model structures,  \citet{pp:86} introduced  L system  symbols as
instructions  controlling a  LOGO-style  turtle \citep{abelson:82}  in
three dimensions, hence the adopted name Turtle graphics.
