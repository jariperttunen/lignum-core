\section{Integrating the L language and LIGNUM}\label{sec:pine}

To model tree structures with L as in LIGNUM let the module $F$ denote
a tree segment and designate module  $B$ for a bud.  Given the modules
for turtle graphics and branching we can now describe the topology and
geometry of  the tree structures  of LIGNUM (Eq.   \ref{eq:tree}) with
rules of the  L language.  To accommodate L with  LIGNUM we first need
to construct an algorithm that translates strings of L into structural
units  of  LIGNUM   (Section  \ref{sec:LToLignum}).   Second,  as  the
metabolism  implemented  in  LIGNUM   will  act  on  structural  units
(segments  and  buds  most  notably)  and  produce  changes  in  their
physiological states,  in their dimensions  and in their  positions in
space  accordingly, this  information  must be  transferred to  turtle
symbols  and module  $B$ as  this is  necessary in  rewriting (Section
\ref{sec:LignumToL}).

We present an  algorithm that translates strings of  L into structural
units of LIGNUM  with the aid of an example with  Scots pine.  We have
programmed  in  L  the  architectural  development of  Scots  pine  in
approximately  the same  way as  it is  in the  LIGNUM  simulations of
\citet{perttunen:96, perttunen:98}; the L program is shown in Appendix
\ref{sec:L1}.  In the program the module $B(A,L)$ represents a bud. In
each iteration  the apical bud ($A  = 1$) moves forward  by the length
$L$ and produces  four new side branches.  The branches  ($A > 1$) are
similar, but only two more side branches are created.  Branching stops
after the third order ($A > 3$), but the extension continues. Also, as
$A$ records  branching it is updated  as new branches  are added. When
the development starts  from the main axis consisting  of one segment,
branching point and bud, the string after two iterations is

\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:pine2}
\lefteqn{F\;[] \;F \; [F[B][B]B]\;[F[B][B]B]\;[F[B][B]B]\;[F[B][B]B] \nonumber }\\
\lefteqn{F \; [B][B][B][B]\; B}
\end{eqnarray}
where symbol  [ denotes $SB()$ and  ] denotes $EB()$,  the modules for
turtle rotations are  not shown, and the arguments  of the modules $B$
and $F$ are dropped.

\subsection{From L to LIGNUM}\label{sec:LToLignum}

We can now  outline a straightforward algorithm to  convert the string
of symbols in L to structural units in LIGNUM using Eq. \ref{eq:pine2}
as a  specific example.  The  algorithm is based on  first recognizing
the main axis  of the tree, then finding the  other axes (branches and
sub-branches), and finally grouping them together as branching points.

First, the  symbol $F(s)$ in  Eq.  \ref{eq:pine2} is interpreted  as a
tree  segment of length  $s$.  The  symbol $B$  corresponds to  a bud.
Each consecutive set of $n$ branches between two $F$ symbols will be a
branching  point with  $n$ axes.   The string  in  Eq.  \ref{eq:pine2}
first  becomes the  main  axis with  three  segments, three  branching
points and the terminating bud:

\begin{equation}
[TS, BP, TS, BP, TS, BP, B]
\end{equation}

The  last two  branching  points  contain four  axes  each, the  first
branching point being empty:

\begin{equation}
[TS, [], TS, [A,A,A,A], TS, [A,A,A,A], B]
\end{equation}

Finally, recursively constructing the axes we get:
\begin{eqnarray}
\lefteqn{[TS, [], TS,[TS,[[B],[B]],B],\ldots, [TS,[[B],[B]],B]], \nonumber} \\
\lefteqn{\;TS, [[B],[B],[B],[B]], B]}
\end{eqnarray}

The current status  of the turtle that is  updated according to turtle
commands in  the string  defines the position  and orientation  of the
tree compartments in LIGNUM.

The structural development of the tree described in L does not require
the regeneration of a LIGNUM representation of trees (deleting the old
tree and  creating a  new one) after  each derivation.   The algorithm
assumes that an  L system indeed generates an  alternating sequence of
tree segments, branching points and terminating buds, and the terminal
buds only generate new structural  units.  The algorithm fails if this
is not the  case.  Thus after each derivation it  is possible to match
the existing  string and LIGNUM  representation and to insert  the new
structural units in  the axis lists before the  terminating buds whose
positions and orientations will be updated.

\subsection{From LIGNUM to L}\label{sec:LignumToL}

Because the architectural  development of a tree is  defined with an L
string we  can assume LIGNUM does  not have to change  the topology of
the tree.  Consequently the conversion from LIGNUM tree to L string is
trivial.
  
However,    as     the    physiological    activities     in    LIGNUM
\citep{perttunen:96} will  change the  dimensions and statuses  of the
tree  segments  and buds,  it  is necessary  to  be  able to  transfer
information from LIGNUM to the  interpretation of the L program.  That
is, the results of the  physiological processes in LIGNUM must be able
to change  the parameter values  of the modules  $F$ and $B$ in  the L
string thus  enabling interaction  between the architectural  part and
the physiological part.

Since the parameter $s$ in  the module $F(s)$ is always interpreted as
the length the turtle moves forward,  and its meaning is the length of
a segment  in LIGNUM, the  conversion algorithm can  implicitly update
the value of $s$ using the length of the corresponding tree segment.

However,  the parameters  for  module $B$  are  model specific.   Thus
explicitly  given the  (C++) type  of the  parameters for  module $B$,
their  assignment statements  and  their variable  names (meaning)  in
LIGNUM, the  conversion algorithm  updates parameter values  of module
$B$ using corresponding variable values from the associated bud.  This
way the results of computations in  LIGNUM are passed to the L system.
(Similarly, the values of the parameters of module $B$ can be assigned
to  the  variables of  the  corresponding  bud  in LIGNUM  in  Section
\ref{sec:LToLignum}).

Technically, each  L file is translated  to C++ and the  result of the
translation  is  a  C++  class providing  an  application  programming
interface  (API) to  the defined  L  system.  Most  notably, this  API
includes derivation of the string to model structural development, the
conversion algorithm  between L system  and the model  LIGNUM (Section
\ref{sec:LToLignum}) and  vice versa.   The translator also  allows to
embed C++ statements in the L file \citep{pp:99a}.

\subsection{Two-way communication in the Scots pine simulation}

Although in our  Scots pine example (Appendix \ref{sec:L1})  it is $L$
in  $B(A,L)$ that  initially determine  the length  of a  segment, the
metabolic processes eventually resolve the amount of growth.
  
We interfaced the L language program of Appendix \ref{sec:L1} with the
functional part of  LIGNUM that incorporates our previous  work on the
Scots pine model \citep{perttunen:96, perttunen:98}.  The calculations
in  LIGNUM include  the pairwise  comparison of  segments in  order to
compute  the  interception  of   solar  radiation  and  the  iterative
allocation of  net photosynthates  to growth after  respiration costs:
\begin{equation} P - M = iW_n + iW_o + iW_r \end{equation}

where  $P$   and  $M$  are  the  photosynthetic   production  and  the
respiration of a  tree, $iW_n$ the growth of  new segments, $iW_o$ the
secondary      growth     and      $iW_r$     the      root     growth
\citep[c.f.][]{perttunen:96,perttunen:98, perttunen:01}.  We omit some
functions of LIGNUM,  e.g. the number of secondary  buds as a function
of  the foliage  mass  of the  mother  segment and  let  the L  system
determine branching.

The simulations  show that the  interaction of the L  language program
and the functioning part of LIGNUM markedly affects the outcome of the
simulation (Figure  \ref{fig:pine}).  Also  the effect of  two extreme
cases  of foliage  mortality show  that  physiological characteristics
have a great effect on  the architecture of the trees.  The simulation
gives a  much shorter  and slimmer  stem due to  the smaller  need for
diameter growth for a pine  with short-living foliage in comparison to
a pine with long-living foliage.
