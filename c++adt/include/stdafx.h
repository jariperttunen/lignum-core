 *This is deliberately empty header file.             *
 *MS VC++ compiler requires stdafx.h to be            *
 *included in every source file (suffix cc, cpp etc.).*
 *On Unix include this file in the beginning of the   *
 *source file. It is not possible to use conditional  *
 *compiling. MS VC++ checks if stdafx.h is truly      *
 *included.                                           *
