An ellipse in 3d is represented by a center C, unit-length axes U and V with
corresponding axis lengths a and b, and a plane contaning the ellipse,
                   N*(X-C)=0 
where N is a unit lenght normal to the plane.
(see David Eberly, http://www.magic-software.com)
The vectors U,V, and N form a right-handed orthonormal coordinate system.
The ellipse is parameterized as

                   X=C + a*cos(t)*U + b*sin(t)*V (1)
for t(-[0,2pi).

               Getting the ellipse points

Let's N(n1,n2,n3)- the normal vector of a plane.

Let's X'=(n3,0,-n1) and
  
                   Xu=X'/|X'|                     (2)
Let's 
                   Yu=Cross(N,Xu)/|Cross(N,Xu)|.  (3)

Then  Xu and Yu could be considered  unit-length axes for the ellipse
and the ellipse obeys the (1) equation.

              When some point B is located inside the ellipse

Consider a plane P given by the normal vector N and the center point C
of the ellipse.
For any point X of the plane we have equation 
                   N*X - N*C=0                    (4)
Consider a line L given by the point O and the direction vector V
For any point of the line L we have equation 
                   X=O + V*t. t(-[0,2pi)          (5)

If the B(bx,by,bz) is the intersection point the L line and the P plane,
than the B point obeys to the following two equations with two unknowens t 
and B:

                   N*B-N*C=0                      (6)
and 
                   B=O+V*t for some t             (7)
Then solution is
                   t1=-(O*N + N*C)/N*V            (8)
and 
                   B=O+t1*V.                      (9)

If the B point is located inside the ellipse the following is true:

              B = C + a*cos(t1)*Xu + b*sin(t1)*Yu (10)
or
                   (bx/a)^2 + (by/b)^2<=1         (11)
