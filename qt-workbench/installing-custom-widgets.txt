Quick instructions for installing WB's custom widgets to the Qt Designer:

- The source and header files of the widget to be installed must be
  added to the install-widget.pro -file's HEADERS and SOURCES lines
  accordingly. Both the files for the actual class of the widget (i.e.
  XMLViewer) AND the it's plugin class (i.e. XMLViewerPlugin for the
  XMLViewer-class) must be specified in the .pro file, or the operation
  won't work. 

  NOTE: Only one custom widget can be loaded at a time for the designer.
  This means that if there is multiple plugin-classes defined in the
  .pro-file only the first of them is installed for the Designer.
  
  In order to install multiple custom widget one must also change the name
  of the .pro-file for each widget (i.e. for XMLViewer .pro-file would be
  XMLViewer.pro) as Qt names the dynamic libraries for the custom
  widgets based on the name of the used .pro-file. 

- Write "qmake <PRO-FILE>", where <PRO-FILE> for the widget to be
  installed.

- Write "make"

- The dynamic library for the widget should be compiled now. It can
  installed by writing "make install". It is likely that administrator's
  rights are needed for the installation to succeed. This can be achieved
  by writing "su" before "make install".

- Designer must be restarted if it were running during the installation
  of the file.
